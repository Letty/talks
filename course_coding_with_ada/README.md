## Programing Fundamentals

**Todo**

* Mini intro ? -> what is programing, difference hardware / software?
* Class and Object
* things to say -> different programming concepts (oop, functional, pointer, multidim arrays like matlab, databases)


* note: the following chapter is not for a specific programing language, its more a generalization to describe the basic concepts in programing 
* language in the text means programing language 

### Data Types, Variables and Assigning Values

*Data Types* 

* every programing language has their own data types
* basic types which appear in most languages
    - boolean (logical value) - true | false
    - numbers - floating and integer numbers
    - strings - everything written

*Variables*

* Constants are values, like Pi, who never change during the program
* variables are changing values in the program

*Assigning Values*

* binding concrete values (numbers, words, complex data structures) to a variable is called assigning
* common syntax are `a = 5` or `a := 5`
